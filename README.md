<h1 align="Left">Hi, I'm Cameron ðŸš€</h1>

I am a junior **software engineering student** studying at Liberty University. I love to learn new things and teach people about programming.

I write blog posts sometimes. Feel free to [read them](https://cameron.rs/blog). Two of my posts were featured on YouTube videos:
- [Python Sucks And I LOVE It | Prime Reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D7FZoQ-z20)
- [Svelte Is Good For Beginners | Prime Reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28NFyGwPHWY)

I'm an **incoming intern @Garmin**!
