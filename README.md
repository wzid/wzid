<h1 align="Left">Hi there, I'm Cameron <img src="assets/wave.gif" width="35px"></h1>

I am a **software engineering student** studying at Liberty University. I love to learn new things and teach people about programming.

Currently I am working for [IPConfigure](https://ipconfigure.com) as a software engineering intern using Java!

Lately, I've spent a lot of time with web development. I recently re-designed my [personal website](https://cameron.rs) to start using TailwindCSS and daisyUI.

I am also getting ready for Fall 2023 when I will start my first year as the President of the Competitive Programming Club.

~I'm currently looking for internships!~ Feel free to contact me at one of the links below.
